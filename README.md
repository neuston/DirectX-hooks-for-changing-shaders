using these wrapper together with fixed shaders often produce 3D Vision Readdy quality,

# Hunting

Allows hunting for shaders and then export them as binary. This allows you to use the external tool for converting shaders to HLSL or if that fails it returns an bit accurate aassembler file.

This project contains on of the few working graphics shader assemblers.

I'm a contributor to the 3DMigoto and there the assembler has allowed many games to be fixed with brilliant result.
